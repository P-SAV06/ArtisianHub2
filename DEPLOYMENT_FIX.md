# 🔧 GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Modern GitHub Actions Workflow**
- Updated to use `actions/deploy-pages@v3` (latest official action)
- Added proper permissions: `contents: read`, `pages: write`, `id-token: write`
- Separated build and deploy jobs for better reliability

### 2. **React Router SPA Support**
- Added `404.html` for client-side routing
- SPA routing scripts in `index.html`
- `_redirects` file for fallback routing

### 3. **GitHub Pages Optimization**
- Added `.nojekyll` to prevent Jekyll processing
- Proper build artifact handling
- Environment-specific deployment settings

## 🌐 Deployment URLs:

## 📋 Next Steps:
1. Visit repository settings → Pages
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" as source
3. Check Actions tab - workflow should now show ✅ green checkmark
4. Visit live site once deployment completes

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:
If issues persist:
- Check repository permissions
- Verify Pages is enabled in settings
- Monitor Actions tab for detailed logs
- Ensure main branch is selected for deployment

The workflow should now deploy successfully! 🚀
