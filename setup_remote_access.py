==========================================

📅 Generated: {time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}
🌍 Access Type: REMOTE (Internet Access)
🏆 Status: ✅ LIVE AND ACCESSIBLE

🎯 MAIN APPLICATION LINKS
==========================================

🖥️ FRONTEND APPLICATION:
{frontend_url if frontend_url else 'Starting...'}

🔧 BACKEND API:
{backend_url if backend_url else 'Starting...'}

📱 TEAM ACCESS INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

✅ SHARE WITH TEAM MEMBERS:
1. Send them the Frontend Application link above
2. They can access from anywhere with internet
3. No VPN or special setup required
4. Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

🧪 FOR TESTING:
• Main App: Use Frontend Application link
• API Testing: Use Backend API link + /api/health
• Mobile: Same links work on mobile devices

🎮 APPLICATION FEATURES TO TEST
==========================================

🤖 AI Features:
• Upload handicraft images for classification
• Get AI-generated prices in Indian Rupees
• Test with different categories

🏪 Marketplace:
• Browse Wooden Dolls, Handlooms, Basket Weaving, Pottery
• View sample Indian artisan products
• Check responsive mobile design

📱 User Experience:
• Test hamburger menu navigation
• Try image upload functionality
• Check smooth animations and UI

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES
==========================================

🔒 SECURITY: These are public URLs - don't share sensitive data
⏰ DURATION: Links stay active while your computer is running
🔄 REFRESH: If you restart, run the remote access script again
🌐 SPEED: Slight delay due to tunneling (normal for remote access)

🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING
==========================================

❌ If links don't work:
1. Check if both frontend and backend servers are running
2. Restart the remote access script
3. Verify ngrok is properly installed

🔧 API Endpoints for Developers:
• Health: {backend_url}/api/health
• Products: {backend_url}/api/products
• Upload: {backend_url}/api/upload-analyze

📞 TEAM SUPPORT
==========================================

If team members have issues:
1. Try the links in incognito/private mode
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. Check internet connection

🎉 Ready for Remote Team Demo!
==========================================

Share the Frontend Application link with your team.
They can now access Artisans Hub from the office! 🚀
